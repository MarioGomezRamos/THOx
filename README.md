 Target excitation included
 Jump included with and without target spin
 Calculation of 3-body cross section parallelised with OpenMP
 
 Issues
 ff.fr cannot be read if it includes spin of target
 For target excitation incoming state of the target must be first and have 0 excitation energy
 Maybe slower than previous versions, must be checked
